# 12-Factor App Principles Application

1. Codebase: 
   - Separate repositories for frontend and backend
   - Version controlled with Git

2. Dependencies: 
   - Use Gemfile for Rails
   - Use package.json for Nuxt.js
   - Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

3. Config: 
   - Externalized configuration via environment variables
   - No hardcoded credentials or URLs

4. Backing Services: 
   - Configurable database connection via environment variables
   - Easily swappable PostgreSQL configuration

5. Build, Release, Run: 
   - Dockerized applications
   - Separate build and runtime stages

6. Processes: 
   - Stateless applications
   - No local storage of user sessions

7. Port Binding: 
   - Expose services on specific ports
   - Runnable without injection of a webserver

8. Concurrency: 
   - Scalable via container orchestration
   - Kubernetes deployment supports horizontal scaling

9. Disposability: 
   - Quick startup and graceful shutdown
   - Containerized for easy replacement

10. Dev/Prod Parity: 
    - Consistent environments via Docker
    - Minimal differences between development and production

11. Logs: 
    - Output logs to stdout/stderr
    - External log aggregation possible

12. Admin Processes: 
    - Rails console and database migrations as separate processes
